# ConfigMgr Module

The "ConfigMgr" PowerShell module is used to directly access the ConfigMgr WMI provider.

As it doesn't have any further dependencies, it's a perfect fit for all scenarios, where ConfigMgr PowerShell scripts shall be used, but the ConfigMgr console can't be installed or used, or where a certain functionality is not availabe. 

### Requirements

PowerShell Version 3.0+
